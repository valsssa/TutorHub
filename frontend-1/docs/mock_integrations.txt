# Mock Integrations & External Services

This document lists the third-party services that are simulated in the frontend prototype to demonstrate production readiness.

## 1. Issue Tracking: YouTrack
*   **Context:** Used in `AdminDashboard.tsx` and `AdminVerificationsPage.tsx`.
*   **Simulation:**
    *   Links verify specific issue IDs (e.g., `VER-101`, `SUP-2401`).
    *   Base URL: `https://valsa.youtrack.cloud`.
    *   Action: Clicking "Report Bug" or ticket links opens a new tab to the external tracker.

## 2. Calendar Sync: Google Calendar
*   **Context:** Used in `TutorScheduleManager.tsx` and `SettingsPage.tsx`.
*   **Simulation:**
    *   UI State: `isCalendarConnected` toggle.
    *   Flow: Clicking "Connect" shows a loading spinner (`isConnecting`) and then transitions to a connected state with a success banner.
    *   Integration: No real OAuth flow is triggered; it is purely a state transition for demonstration.

## 3. Payments: Stripe Connect
*   **Context:** Used in `TutorEarningsPage.tsx` and `PaymentPage.tsx`.
*   **Simulation:**
    *   UI displays card brand icons (Visa, Mastercard).
    *   "Payout Method" section simulates a connected bank account/card.
    *   Platform billing status in Admin Dashboard.

## 4. Video Conferencing: WebRTC
*   **Context:** Used in `Classroom.tsx`.
*   **Simulation:**
    *   Interface: Mimics a standard video call layout (Self view, Remote view, Controls).
    *   State: `micOn`, `cameraOn` toggle local UI states.
    *   Chat: Simulated "System" and "Tutor" messages appear automatically to demonstrate interactivity.
    *   Whiteboard: Placeholder UI for interactive canvas.

## 5. AI Search: Google Gemini
*   **Context:** Used in `MarketplacePage.tsx` via `services/geminiService.ts`.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE / REAL**.
    *   Unlike the others, this integration actually calls the Google GenAI SDK if an API key is present in the environment.
    *   It parses natural language queries into structured JSON filters.
